# Swatch Internet Time

Welcome — this org is a small collection of apps and tools around Swatch Internet Time ('.beats').

For now this is a placeholder README. I’m actively developing several projects and will expand documentation here as they mature.

## Current projects

- Plain JavaScript demo app (initial, small & simple)
- Preact app (in development) — repo: @kendawson-online/swatch-preact
  - Demo site: https://swatchtime.online

## API

There is a simple API that returns the current Swatch Internet Time. Documentation is TODO.

- Endpoint (example): https://api.swatchtime.online/api/v1/current

I will add full API docs, usage examples, and client libraries here soon.

## Planned projects

More apps and tools I plan to build and add to this organization:

- Android app
- Desktop app (cross-platform)
- Smart watch (WearOS) app
- Website widgets / embeddable clocks
- Generic library to help others build Swatch Internet Time clocks

## Contributing

This is a work in progress. Contributions, issues, and ideas are welcome. For now, open issues in the appropriate repository (or in this org if you need a general discussion), and I’ll triage them as projects become ready.

This README is a placeholder; I’ll refine it and add links, documentation, and project pages as the apps are developed.
